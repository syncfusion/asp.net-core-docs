# TagCloud

The ASP.NET Core TagCloud control allows the user to display a list of links or tags with a structured cloud format where the importance of the tags can differentiate with varied font sizes, colors, and styles.

## Key Features

* Data binding: Supports data binding with JSON data as well as remote data.
* Accessible: Supports adding or removing tags dynamically.
* Format: Supports tag structure in both cloud format and list format.
* Font-size: Supports limiting the font size with a minimum and maximum range.
* RTL: Supports changing the TagCloud direction for right-to-left alignment.
* Themes: JavaScript controls include 12 built-in themes (6 flat and 6 gradient effects) and also support a custom skin option to set user defined themes.
